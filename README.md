# Burger

## Description 

This app will allow the user to log the name of a burger into the DOM through the use of MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. 

## Usage 

The Burger Bar is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they would like to eat.

After the user has submitted a burger name, that burger will be stored in the database and displayed in the Burger Menu to the left of the screen. A button will appear next to the burger's name which will allow you to devour the burger when you are ready.  

Once the user clicks on the devour button, the burger will no longer be available to eat, so it will move to the right hand menu that lists all the burgers that have been consumed. 

The database will store every burger if it has or hasn't been devoured.

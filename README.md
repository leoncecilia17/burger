# burger

In this assingment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Expres , Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. 
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. 
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour It Button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
